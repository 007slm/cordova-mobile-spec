## Mobile Spec Suite ##

These specs are designed to run inside the mobile device that implements it - _it will fail in the DESKTOP browser_.

You should include the PhoneGap JavaScript file (phonegap.js) in this project.

The goal is to test mobile device functionality inside a mobile browser.
Where possible, the PhoneGap API lines up with HTML 5 spec. Maybe down
the road we could use this spec for parts of HTML 5, too :)
